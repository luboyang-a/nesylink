# NesyLink Documentation

This documentation is focused on using `nesylink` as a Gymnasium-compatible
reinforcement learning environment.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `guides/env-overview.md`
   - Environment architecture, package boundaries, built-in tasks, and the
     Gymnasium usage flow.
2. `guides/map-creation.md`
   - How to create JSON maps with rooms, objects, exits, and validation rules.
3. `reference/game-content.md`
   - Current player capabilities, items, monsters, map object meanings, exit
     requirements, and built-in map content.
4. `reference/rewards.md`
   - Built-in reward modules, reward signals, weight overrides, and custom
     rewards.
5. `guides/training-config.md`
   - Practical training configuration patterns for random rollouts, PPO-style
     loops, and Dreamer-style wrappers.
6. `reference/env-api.md`
   - Exact `reset`, `step`, action, observation, and `info` contracts.
7. `reference/tasks-and-validators.md`
   - Python task registry and task-level environment construction.

## Documentation Scope

Keep docs centered on:

- creating environments
- understanding the architecture
- authoring maps and tasks
- configuring rewards
- training RL agents
- reading observations, events, and episode metadata

Avoid adding evaluation process notes, contributor workflow logs, or unrelated
project history here unless they directly help a user run or extend the
environment.
